# jQuery Google Location Picker

### What is this?

A jQuery implementation of Google Maps Autocomplete API. 

### Why?

I needed a box for users to select their location; the box needed to be able to suggest locations and collect a lot of details, such as Country, City, State, Geo Coordinates, Maps URL, etc.  And it needed to be super-incredibly-easy for users to use, and provide up-to-date data from locations around the globe. 

I could not find a good library which provided up-to-date data, most implementations hard-coded a list of countries or cities.
